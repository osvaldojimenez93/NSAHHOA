#### Autumn Mist Closure

Over the last couple of weeks, the city has placed signage across all main roads leading to Autumn Mist to inform people of the Autumn Mist Closure in and out of Alamo Ranch. The road has been closed as of June 15th and will remain temporarily closed all summer through September 15th. The HOA and City Council will revisit the consensus for next steps based on the majority of our residentsâ€™ requests. For questions or concerns, please contact the District 6 office at 210-207-7065 or email them at council.district6@sanantonio.gov. You can also make your voice heard at [SASpeakUp.com/AutumnMist](https://saspeakup.com/AutumnMist) .

#### 1604 Access Road Slowdown Lane

According to city staff, the construction of the deceleration lane is scheduled to begin in the fall. The HOA board will be in close communication with the District 6 office and will provide more details as they become available.

#### Homeless Encampments

Please be aware and remain cautious around the Misty Woods and 1604 greenbelt. It has come to our attention that there is a homeless encampment in the area with approximately 10-20 individuals. The Department of Human Services will be assessing the location and then schedule an abatement (clean-up) of the property.

A few of you may have noticed construction equipment in and around Summer Breeze and Enchanted Sunset. Crews have begun clearing pathways to take soil samples for an additional storage complex which means we are expected to have a storage development at both entrances to the neighborhood.
